1- Main app components are jsx files for modularity 
2- dynamic values (that change on user screen) are achived by using (useState) hook
3- doing something on each render on inital render is achived by using (useEffect) hook
4- http requests library such as axios is used to comunicate with back-end (send values, get values, update and delete values from backend) (at this point there is no database)

5- make back-end with a middleware such as express to handle requests and responses to update values, use another middleware (cors) to make comunication possible 
6- don't forget to lisetn to a port so front-end can comunicate with back-end
7- deploy back-end and make front end send and recive data from its url, at this time still no database
8- use npm run build on front end to make a A production build 
9- copy production build to back-end dir and refactor
10- study what app.use(express.static('dist')) again

11- now its time for a database, first chose what kind of database to use
12- make .env file and a .gitignore so we can ignore sensitve info when pushing to github
13- make a dir for database connection 
14- refactor code to use with database
15- handle common errors
16- Moving error handling into middleware


things to study:
    unknownEndpoint
    requestLogger
    middlewares
    routes
